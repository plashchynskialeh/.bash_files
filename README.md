# .bash_files

My favorite set of shortcuts, aliases, perferences, predefined (environment) variables and such at your fingertips.

* `.profile` is for things that are not specifically related to Bash, like environment variables `PATH` and friends, and should be available anytime. 
* `.bashrc` is for the configuring the interactive Bash usage, like Bash aliases, setting your favorite editor, setting the Bash prompt, etc.
* Â `.bash_profile` is for making sure that both the things in .profile and .bashrc are loaded for login shells. 
*  .bash_aliases
